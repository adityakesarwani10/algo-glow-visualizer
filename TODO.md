# TODO: Modernize UI to Futuristic Style and Update Meta Image

## Tasks
- [x] Verify meta image path in index.html (ensure it points to public/logo.png)
- [x] Update color scheme in src/index.css with futuristic hues (electric blues, purples, neon accents) and add glow effects
- [x] Apply glassmorphism (backdrop-blur, semi-transparent backgrounds) to panels and cards in src/index.css
- [x] Enhance VisualizerBars.jsx with glowing animations, hover effects, and smoother transitions
- [x] Update ControlPanel.jsx with floating button styles, gradients, and interactive animations
- [x] Add subtle animations (fade-ins, scale effects) and futuristic elements to AlgorithmVisualizer.jsx
- [x] Ensure dark mode complements the futuristic theme with enhanced contrasts in src/index.css

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the app locally to ensure UI renders correctly and animations work
- [ ] Verify responsiveness and theme toggle functionality
- [ ] Adjust colors or effects based on visual feedback if needed
